# Azure Traffic Manager extension for Azure DevOps
Custom extension to manage an Azure Traffic Manager instance from an Azure DevOps build/release pipeline

## Purpose of the project
The project derived from the conversion of an existing set of PowerShell scripts into a custom Azure DevOps extension. It was used as a baseline for articles, conference talks as well as labs, but eventually it ended up in a working state so I decided to publish it here for general consumption.
